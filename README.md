## One Line...

One line a Day is a unique journaling application which allows users to enter the highlight of their day in under 250 characters. 

The app allows users to view their memories as a list of entries to scroll through, or to view the diary as a calendar so that they can easily select days they wish to look back on.

## Upcoming features

In the future, the app will allow users to:
- "Favourite" certain entries
- Categorise certain entries as good memories / bad memories
- Add custom tags to entries (ie "grandma", "holiday in venice")
- Ability to add images to entries

## Usage
