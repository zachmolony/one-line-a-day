## One Line...

One line a Day is a unique journaling application which allows users to enter the highlights of their day in under 250 characters. 

Our app has been built with a sleek minimalist design, and entries are sorted and displayed, meaning keeping your story up to date is intuitive and effortless.

The app allows users to view their memories as a list of entries to scroll through, or to view the diary as a calendar so that they can easily select days they wish to look back on.

## Upcoming features

In the future, the app will allow users to:
- "Favourite" certain highlights
- Categorise certain highlights (ie "happy", "funny")
- Add custom tags to highlights (ie "grandma", "holiday in venice")
- Ability to add images to highlights

Depending on how the user tags their days, the calendar will be colour coded to reflect that attribute.
